## Arduino library for passive buzzers with tones and figures
you can use notes like:

-a for A
-as for A#
-gb for Gb

and figures like 1 for a quarter note

the syntax you should use the dbuzzer is:

play(note, figure, octave);

the default octave is 1, but you can use 0.5 or 0.25 for lower octaves or 2 and 3 for upper octaves
